      Hello, My name is Carmen Park, my pronouns are they/them, and
      I am currently an undergraduate student studying Mandarin Chinese
      and Mathematics and Computer Science* at the university of Oregon.
          I am passionate about design as a broader concept, and its 
      broader influence on "life"?<br>
         <br>    I hope to learn more about graphics summer 2025. I will be 
      conducting undergraduate research with Jason Murphy on geopmetric
      optics and forier analysis. I will be implementing my work digitally,
      and by the end of the summer I hope to have a better understanding of
      linear transormations, their use in software, perspective and focal length
      calculations in 3D space, and finally other things like light, rendering
      that are also applied digitally to emulate human vision.
